  :alt: Documentation Status

Django Yubin allows the programmer to control when he wants to send the e-mail
in this application, making the web application to answer fast as it not has to
wait for the mail server.

As in our projects we use always two django packages for dealing with emails:
django-mailer2 (our own fork in APSL) and django-mailviews to compose the
emails we decided to create this package to fit our own needs and share with
the community.

As you can see it seems django-mailer2 is not accepting patches, so in
order to put a new version on pypi a new name was mandatory.  So django-yubin was born
(yubin is postal mail in japanese). The name attribution is for @morenosan.

How it works
------------

Yubin replaces the standard Django Email Backend with its own. Instead of sending
the e-mail trough the SMTP server Yubin stores the e-mails on the database and
allows you to sent them using a cron command.

Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~

* Your application can answer faster, as other process is going to take care of
  connecting with the SMTP server and sending the e-mail.

* Yubin stores the e-mail and allows you to retrieve using the admin. Even with
  the attachments.

* Yubin allows to define prioritary queues, resend e-mails

* Yubin helps in your development.  It's a good way to work when you're developping
  the application and you don't want to flood your test users with
  e-mails. With Django Yubin, and without running the cron commands, you can see how
  your e-mails are, retrieve them and even delete them with out sending it.

On production mode you'll just nedd to add a cron entry in your server to send the e-mails,
someting like

    * * * * * (cd $PROJECT; python manage.py send_mail >> $PROJECT/cron_mail.log 2>&1)

This will send the queued e-mail every minute.

Django Yubin is a fork from django-mailer2 with some addtions from django-mailviews and
additional improvements made from apsl.net that we need for our daly basis workd. It
has also contributions from other people, so don't heasitate to read the humans.txt.

django-mailer-2 by is a Chris Beaven fork from a fork of
James Tauber's django-mailer and is a reusable Django app for queuing the sending of email.

django-mailviews from Disqus, allows you to compose e-mails using templates in
the same way you compose your html templates, and allows you to preview the
e-mails.

If you want to run the test you'll need a test smtpd server, you can find one in

    ./bin/fake-server

run it in a different console and execute `runtests.py`

You can read the package documentation at http://django-yubin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
